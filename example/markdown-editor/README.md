Collaborative Markdown Editor
-----------------------------

A little editor, you should be able to run [./build.sh] from this folder (after pinning things like the [Mithril bindings](https://github.com/patricoferris/jsoo-mithril) and Dream) and then open two clients and then "collaboratively" edit the markdown.
